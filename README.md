## pnote - open-source, offline, retro and easy note taking application.

The goal behind pnote was to replace windows' notepad. I doubt there is any tracking data within notepad, however it's a step forward
towards making everything open-source and clear, before Google & OpenAI take over the world. At least some of us can be saved digitally.

pnote, can be downloaded for windows users via this [link](https://mega.nz/file/M7kk2IxZ#8sMe2wamLpTKO_aSDWToa67rVbh4G3OgUXU-7xbruHM).

To compile it by yourself on windows, run the following:

$ pip install pyinstaller

$ pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole app.py

The application will be named app, and will be located in the dist folder. 

For Linux users, you can run it by typing: 

$ python3 app.py

Dependancies:

$ pip install tk

if it didn't work, run the following:

$ sudo [[package-manager, exp: apt]] install python3-tkinter

Run everything at your own risk. I am not responsible for any problem you face. 

If any problem is faced, please do not hesitate to contact me or send a report.
